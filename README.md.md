This is a template for my Obsidian vault. Each of the listed directories is filled with a `sample` item in order to preserve the vault's structure.

The workflow follows the Zettelk√§sten method as used by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), but in digital format. To keep it simple:
1. Fleeting notes go into the `inbox` directory.
2. Fleeting notes are transformed into permanent notes, which reside in the `zettelkasten` directory, in one of its two subdirectories:
	- `literature_notes` are maps of content for my readings (books, journal articles, web pages, etc.)
	- `main_notes` contain my own thoughts on whatever I read
3. If a fleeting note is not processed immediately (i.e., the first 1-2 weekends after having been captured), but they might still hold some value in the future, they are sent to the `cache` directory. Otherwise, they are deleted.

Other files:
1. Various external files and drawings are sent to the `attachments` directory.
2. Canvases are sent to the `canvases` directory.
3. The starting points (i.e., overviews) of my projects reside in the `projects` directory.
4. The `index` directory also holds maps of content, but their purpose, unlike the literature notes, is to create clusters meant to facilitate interdisciplinary connections.

In order to streamline the writing process and worry about one less thing, create and name notes with the [Unique note creator](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/unique-note) core plugin, using the default date/time pattern `YYYYMMDDHHmm`. To provide files with a human-readable name, use file [properties](https://help.obsidian.md/properties) and create maps of content (or tables of content) with [Dataview queries](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/). To see individual file properties, hit the `<Ctrl> + P` shortcut to open the command palette and type `Properties view: Show file properties`. After creating a note, use a template from the `templates` directory. All types of notes are covered.

I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a reference manager. Make sure you have the [Better BibTeX plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) installed, then learn how to easily integrate Zotero in the workflow by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yMko1m8XSQ).

Enjoy the work!
